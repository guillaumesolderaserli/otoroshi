# Choose your datastore

Right now, Otoroshi supports multiple datastore. 

You can choose one datastore over another depending on your use case. 

Available datastores are the following 

* in memory
* levelDB
* redis
* cassandra


The levelDB datastore is pretty handy for testing purposes, but is not supposed to be used in production mode.

The in-memory datastore is kind of interesting. It can be used for testing purposes, but it is also a good candidate for production because of its fastness. But in that case, you need to provide a way to feed the deployed in-memory instances after the initial boot. In a future release, we will provide a master/workers slave based on Otoroshi in memory instances and kafka (see https://github.com/MAIF/otoroshi/issues/8 for more details about the feature)

The redis datastore is quite nice when you want to easily deploy several Otoroshi instances. If you need a datastore more scalable than redis, then you can use the cassandra datastore.

We plan to add more datastores support in the future :)
